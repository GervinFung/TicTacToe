## Getting Started

- I have decided to rewrite a TicTacToe game as the previous version is written badly
- Started TicTacToe to understand how MiniMax algorithm actually works

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
- `res`: the folder to maintain resources

## To start the game

This is a multithreaded tic-tac-toe game that allows user to choose between playing against AI or another friend
No. | Steps
--- | ---
1.| Double click TicTacToe.jar file
2.| There's a menu that let you decide AI level, Grid Level, Start or Exit Game
3.| Watch 2 AI play against each other, or play against your friend, or play against AI
4.| User must choose the grid layout before they can start the game, which range from 3x3 and 10x10
5.| The game will restart when there's a winner, or it is a draw
6.| Different game layout can be chosen as well
